I'm figuring out the markdown blog slowly and steadily.

Here's the flow


- PostMetric.tsx
  - usePostLikes.tsx (from lib)
    - api/likes/slug.ts prisma finally understanding
  - usePostViews.tsx (from lib)


so build backend first? keep modifying until needs are met.

`crypto` createHash
`prisma` - for backend
`zod` - backend type validation


so in prisma you can infer and that's insane lmeow.

also have to add `"postinstall": "prisma generate"`

```
Introspected 2 models and wrote them into prisma/schema.prisma in 1.66s
```

so that was insane.

very close, good inferring, but I actually need it for better needs.

installed `@prisma/client`
